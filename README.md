## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.sh/) installed
- Node.js 18.x or later

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LoganBrinkley/nansen-design-agent.git
cd nansen-design-agent
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser and follow the setup process:
   - You'll be prompted to enter your Figma credentials
   - The application will validate your credentials and configure the environment
   - Once configured, you'll have access to Nansen's design system

### Figma Setup

The application requires access to Nansen's Figma design system. You'll need:

1. A Figma Access Token:
   - Log in to Figma
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Account ‚Üí Personal access tokens
   - Create a new access token
   - Copy the token when prompted (you won't be able to see it again)

   - Open Nansen's design system in Figma
   - The file key is in the URL: figma.com/file/FILE_KEY/...
   - Copy the FILE_KEY portion

These credentials will be securely stored in your local environment and used to sync with Nansen's design system.
